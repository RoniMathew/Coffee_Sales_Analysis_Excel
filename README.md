COFFEE SALES ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL
Abstract
In this research, coffee sales data is examined using Microsoft Excel and a dashboard, with a specific focus on crucial elements such as the average sales of various coffee types, cumulative sales by country over time, top customers, and the overall sales trajectory. The primary objective is to reveal valuable insights about consumer preferences, regional differences, and customer behaviour. By making use of Excel's tools, including charts and tables, this analysis offers a clear and detailed comprehension of the coffee market, providing practical guidance for businesses seeking to refine their strategies.

Dataset
The "Coffee Product Analytics" dataset gives a detailed look at different coffee products, covering types, roast levels, sizes, pricing, and profitability. It's a valuable tool for businesses and analysts looking to understand and improve their coffee product lineup.

Methodology
The dataset comprised three tables: order, products, and customers. A new table was formed by extracting necessary columns using functions like XLOOKUP and Index matching from these three tables. Following that, the data underwent transformation and cleaning. Subsequently, pivot tables, tables, and visualizations were generated for further analysis.
 

Results
A dashboard was developed, emphasizing essential elements, including the average sales of diverse coffee types, cumulative sales by country over time, top customers, and overarching trends in sales.
 

Conclusion
When examining the chart illustrating total sales by country over time, it becomes evident that the United States outperforms both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Similarly, when analyzing the chart depicting average sales of different coffee types, it is observed that Excelsa and Liberica exhibit superior performance compared to Arabica and Robusta, despite fluctuations in their sales over time.
